"Create another vSwitch with no physical adapters. Create a routing VM such as pfSense with two vNICâ€™s. The LAN interface should connect to your host only vSwitch and the WAN to your other one. Place your VMs on a port group on the host only vSwitch. Use firewall rules on the router VM to control traffic. You will need to add a static route on your Internet connected router that routes your host only subnet to the WAN IP of the virtual router."
