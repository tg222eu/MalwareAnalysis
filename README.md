<h3>Preparing a network</h3>

We need to create a VM sandbox enviroment. But before we do that we need to create an isolated network to protect the home computers if something goes wrong. I will be creating a guest network which purpose is to isolate from the LAN network and from each others. It will only have access to the internet.

In my case I am using VMware esxi 6.7 and will briefly explain that I have to create a virtual switch thats named GUESTNET, that I attached to the Port groups. No physical NIC attached. This switch will be attached as a Network adapter in my virtual firewall OpnSense.

Now that we have a virtual network for the guestnetwork we can configure it in the firewall. In my case when adding a new network adapter in vmware I had to reassign the interface in OpnSense since all the network adapters got renamed inside OpnSense, example the WAN interface vmx1 became vmx2 etc.

In OpnSense, go to Interface and Assignments, click on the plus sign and choose the interface you just created. You can compare the MAC address.

Once created you can now click on GUESTNET under interface and hit enable.
