Install win 10 on virtual machine
Win10 host 8 gig ram with 80 disk space

Configure "Host only adapter" to prevent a malware to spread
"Create another vSwitch with no physical adapters. Create a routing VM such as pfSense with two vNICâ€™s. The LAN interface should connect to your host only vSwitch and the WAN to your other one. Place your VMs on a port group on the host only vSwitch. Use firewall rules on the router VM to control traffic. You will need to add a static route on your Internet connected router that routes your host only subnet to the WAN IP of the virtual router."


"Thanks to those who have responded-- I decided not to delete this post in the event it helps someone else, but I should clarify what I was asking as I've noticed a slew of questions that seem to have the same misconception as myself... this contributed to my confusion, lol

I've become so acclimatedto the host-only networking being on my machine as I was using Workstation. Therefore my intention was to enable my "host" machine (normal workstation and not actually the esxi host) to have access to devices on ESXi which are isolated from the internet and on a specific subnet, not addressable by other devices. Really, I was attempting to accomplish multiple things in one wrong question.

What I ended up doing was the following, as suggested by many, but here are the steps:

Create a separate switch named 'HostOnly' with no uplink

Create a pfSense VM

Give the pfSense two network cards attached to the following:

VM Network

HostOnly

Configure the pfSense to have DHCP on 1 (WAN), static on 2 (LAN)

Create a rule to allow WAN IPs (VM Network, it's bridged) to hit the pfSense webConfigurator

Disable the rule to block Private IPs from hitting the pfSense

Create a rule to block all outbound from LAN -> WAN

Create forwarding rules to assign specific ports to LAN addresses, e.g.

pfSense:3389 -> 10.0.0.2:3389

pfSense:3388 -> 10.0.0.3:3389

etc"
